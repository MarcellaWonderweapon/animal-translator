# Animal Translator - the big picture

- **make it responsive**
- while doing so, brush up your skills (course Kevin Powell)
- (when responsive: ask people about DarkTheme / LightTheme)
- (maybe: useContext for DarkTheme)
- make your code more concise (CSS: variables ect)
- **animal sounds** (download or build your own API)
- improve **speech bubble animation** (discard display none, use position & opacity OR animate height)
- design aesthetic **alarms** (touching animals - with cute images, i.e. scared bee)
- optimize performance & accessibility (lighthouse, images, ...)
- learn and apply SASS
- add a German version (useContext)
