# Animal Translator - things to work on

- ~~**make it responsive**~~
- ~~while doing so, brush up your skills (course Kevin Powell)~~
- (when responsive: ask people about DarkTheme / LightTheme)
- (maybe: useContext for DarkTheme)
- make your code more concise (CSS: variables ect)
- ~~**animal sounds** (download or build your own API)~~ ->API next time!
- improve **speech bubble animation** (discard display none, use position & opacity OR animate height)
- design aesthetic **alarms** (touching animals - with cute images, i.e. scared bee)
- ~~learn and apply SASS~~
- add a German version (useContext)
- Performance at mobile is quite bad (Chrome Lighthouse: 76%) -> Learn more about performance for mobile and fix it
- For desktop, Chrome Lighthouse is not able to calculate the performance -> find the reason and fix it
