# Animal Translator - things to work on

- ~~**make it responsive**~~
- ~~while doing so, brush up your skills (course Kevin Powell)~~
- (when responsive: ask people about DarkTheme / LightTheme)
- (maybe: useContext for DarkTheme)
- make your code more concise (CSS: variables ect)
- ~~**animal sounds** (download or build your own API)~~ ->API next time!
- improve **speech bubble animation** (discard display none, use position & opacity OR animate height)
- design aesthetic **alarms** (touching animals - with cute images, i.e. scared bee)
- ~~learn and apply SASS~~
- add a German version (useContext)
- Performance at mobile is quite bad (Chrome Lighthouse: 76%) -> Learn more about performance for mobile and fix it
- For desktop, Chrome Lighthouse is not able to calculate the performance -> find the reason and fix it
- I noticed, that the results for mobile can be actually different from what I see on my Dev tools. Also, I don't know how to test certain features like swiping. I ended up pushing to Git WAY to much. That can't be best practice and I want to learn how this really works.
- There are still some minor bugs. For example, in mobile if you touch the animal, sometimes the audio sound will play, sometimes not. Weird! When the user is to hasty, both speech bubbles show up (touch & talk). The alarm gets triggered to easily, that's not a good user experience. I am pretty sure, there a some responsiveness issues on some devices for some animals. But still, way to go!
