## A project about intercultural animal-competence, build in React

When it was time to build our first React project on our own, our teacher gave us good advice: "Just think about a problem people might have, then build an app that solves that problem."

Having that in mind, I came up with something literally nobody needs: an Animal Translator.

What is an Animal Translator, you might ask.

An Animal Translator translates animal sounds - or to be more precise, the way humans interpret animal sounds.

You thought, dogs say "woof" around the globe? I certainly did! But, far from it. Very much to my surprise and amusement, I learned a few months ago that Dutch dogs say "Blav". Spanish dogs say "Guau", Chinese ones "Wang" and so on.

Makes you wonder - what else don't I know? The world is a marvelous place and you never know what you might discover round the next corner.

Building the project was a lot of fun, and bringing more fun and beauty into the world is certainly of value on its own, I suppose.

But while I was building this project, I realized its more subtle value: it is not about intercultural animal-competence, you know.

It is about intercultural competence between humans - celebrating the little differences, the diversity, and at the same time recognizing that we all share the same essence.

The way we interpret animal sounds might differ, but we all DO interpret them.

This project is a playful contribution to the appreciation of cultural diversity - without the need to lecture or patronize.

So have fun with the Animal Translator and let me know what you think about it -> marcellaberlin[at]posteo.de or Marcella von der Weppen at Linkedin.

In the "about" folder you can:

- read more about my takeaways from this project in my personal coder's diary (src > about > challenges+takeaways.md)
- get to know which improvements I am still going to make (src > about > to-do.md), as this is a work in progress.

This project is somewhat responsive (with some improvements yet to come).

It was built in **100% Vanilla CSS** and **React**.
